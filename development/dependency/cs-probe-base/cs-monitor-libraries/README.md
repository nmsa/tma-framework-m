# TMA-Monitor `C#` Client Library 

Main dependency to use during the development of `TMA Monitor` probes developed in `C#`.


## Prerequisites

You need [mono](https://www.mono-project.com/docs/about-mono/languages/csharp/) to build this project.

If you cannot install `mono` in your system, you should use the `docker` image available at [cs-probe-base](../). In this case, `docker` is mandatory.


## Build

To build the library, you need to run the following command.

```sh
mcs -target:library -out:monitor-client.dll -r:Newtonsoft.Json.dll -r:log4net.dll observation.cs message.cs data.cs SynchronousClient.cs AssemblyInfo.cs
```

**Note:** As an alternative, you can take advantage of the [cs-probe-base](../) docker image to ease your deployment.

## Usage

To use the monitor-client in the development of your probe, you just need to include the DLL generated by the previous command in your `C#` project.

Note: check the [probe-cs-demo](../../../probes/probe-cs-demo) for mode detailed demonstration of the usage.
